   <h1>Michael Westerlund</h1>
   <p><em><a href="https://www.ewu.edu/">Honors Graduate</a>, Creator Sales Associate, Purchasing Coordinator, Project Lead, <strong>Digital Content Manager, and Web Developer</strong></em></p>
   <p>I have spent the last four years working closely with business owners and managers to facilitate new project endeavors. Meeting deadlines, facilitating employee’s needs, implementing ergonomic requirements and safety standards are all very familiar to me. I have the skills necessary to perform various administrative and project-oriented tasks that align with the responsibilities of the position. I have worked regularly with industry related software. My duties required detailed knowledge of pricing, inventory management, multi-level communication to align department and top-level management objectives, as well as negotiating and finalizing project details. Responsibilities also provided me experience in understanding and complying with building codes and regulations. Although I am a recent college graduate, I have a strong work ethic, practical experience, and great ambition. I am confident I would show to be a beneficial addition.</p>
